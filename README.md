# Analysis

Smaller Charter schools have higher Math & Reading Passing Rates as well as Overall Passing Rates even though they are still much smaller (by student count) than most District Schools. One contributing factor for that is that they still have competetive spending ranges per student.

The District schools perform similarly with one another regardless of student body size. Even a school with around 2k students more than another will produce similar passing rates.
